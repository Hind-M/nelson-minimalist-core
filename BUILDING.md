# Building Nelson

Depending on what platform or features you require, the build process may
differ slightly. After you've successfully built a binary, running the
test suite to validate that the binary works as intended is a good next step.

If you consistently can reproduce a test failure, search for it in the
[Nelson issue tracker](https://github.com/Nelson-numerical-software/nelson/issues) or
file a new issue.
